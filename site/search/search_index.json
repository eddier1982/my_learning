This shift has put purchasing power in the hands of developers in ways that have broken traditional procurement processes. DevOps and cloud have forced the removal of constraints that has led to the need for a new operating model. This new model allows for collaborative decision making and gives companies the ability to continue to maximize the value of IT investment. This is the premise that led to the development of FinOps. DevOps & Cloud allow for all costs to be attributed to owners The cost of goods sold for our IT-enabled products and the cost per user of support systems, have always relied upon data centers and infrastructure whose cost is unchangeable. Product owners now have the ability to consume IT services in the exact mix and at the exact times when needed. Product owners can also build in such a way that all of the costs can be examined and taken into account in the pricing, support, and agile development processes. The cloud gives us the ability to develop applications on architectures that scale appropriately to demand, matching IT supply and demand more effectively than ever possible in the data center. All the while, improving our ability to buy incremental small systems and scale to massive heights. DevOps & Cloud offer unprecedented opportunities Procurement and finance now have the ability to see spending in real-time as well as granularity and attribution. Technology leaders who previously needed to face product demand, changes in technology trends, and data center infrastructure challenges, now have the ability to build incrementally. DevOps engineers, once constrained to whatever the infrastructure team had previously purchased within the confines of the data center, are now free to consider using a wide \u2013 and ever growing \u2013 selection of technologies to solve a range of customer needs. And, more importantly to the organization, DevOps engineers have the right to buy and use only what they need at any given moment. How do we develop the ability to tackle these challenges and take advantage of these new opportunities? FinOps The New Operating Model for the Cloud For many organizations, FinOps is the new operating model for the cloud. FinOps is the practice of bringing technology, business, and finance together to master the unit economics of cloud for competitive advantage. It brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud. Cloud FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice. FinOps enables organizations to get maximum business value Creating a Culture of Accountability FinOps creates a culture of accountability by supporting product, finance, and business teams to collaborate and make real-time decisions related to tradeoffs between cost, speed, and quality. This drives decisions that increase business value to enhance efficiency and better align costs to business needs as well as improving forecasting of cloud costs. Before moving on ...

Cost Allocation In FinOps, the ability to identify and allocate costs to the appropriate cost categories in use by a customer. Ideally direct costs (the cost of resources running in my accounts), amortized costs (the amortization of prepaid costs paid upfront for RIs applied in my accounts), and shared costs (my share of common services accounts run by others on my behalf) can be allocated to individual budgeting categories for a clear view of the entire cost of running my application or workload in the cloud.

Sprint A \u201cCrawl, Walk, Run\u201d approach to performing FinOps enables organizations to start small, and grow in scale, scope and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity. Taking quick action at a small scale and limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and to gain insights into the value of taking further action in a larger, faster, or more granular way. Reference: Please review this page before the exam. FinOps Maturity Model 'Establish FinOps Culture' would be under what domain according to the FinOps Foundation? Organizational Alignment Explanation: There are six specific domains in FinOps according to the FinOps Foundation. We will want to be able to understand what topics are covered by each domain. Multiple Selection:(Select two). Which of the following statements would be true regarding deploying Kubernetes clusters concerning cost complexity? Generally organizations have multiple teams consuming portions of those underlying container resources The average lifespan of a container being one day versus a typically much longer utilization time for a VM Explanation: Managing Kubernetes clusters on just about any cloud platform is very challenging due to the complexity of how Kubernetes is deployed, how resources are consumed and the general lack of real time visibility. Secondly, all providers charge for additional resource usage so for the example the amount of bandwidth or storage API access may not be visible even with tagging. Please refer to this page before the exam. Calculating Container Costs (finops.org) Which of the following is the best definition of a Kubernetes Pod? A pod consists of a group of containers and treats them as a single block of resources that can be scheduled and scaled on the cluster. Explanation: The other answers are incorrect and are variations of the correct answer. Reference: Please review the terminology here for containers. Calculating Container Costs (finops.org) _ _ _ _ _ _ or _ _ _ _ _ _ is the foundation of telling apart workloads in the cloud, identifying ownership, and attributing costs to teams.

Accurate Cloud Forecasts (finops.org) . Multiple Selection:(Select three) Cloud Forecasting can be a challenge, especially in large disparate organizations. Centralization can be a helpful factor but also there are some focus areas that we can use to 'break the challenge into addressable parts'. Tagging and cost allocation can provide insight into resource spending. Use forecasting models to help provide predicable models for consistency. Use communications to relay that forecasting is being used for decision making Explanation: The other answers are incorrect. For example, we can use both third party and provider tools since some providers may not provide all the reports, features etc. we may want. It is also a Finops best practice to actually centralize our FinOps practice and provide consistency in our reporting/forecasting. Reference: https://www.finops.org/projects/accurate-cloud-forecasts/ True or False: Distributed decision making coupled with the move to variable spending in cloud allows technology teams to efficiently partner with finance and business teams to make informed decisions that drive continual optimization. True Explicaci\u00f3n Statement is correct. Remember that FinOps is really about collaboration. Reference: FinOps Foundation - What is FinOps? When comparing TBM and FinOps, which one would focus on results mainly on speed? FinOps FinOps is focused on results much more frequently than with TBM. TBM is monthly or quarterly focused whereas FinOps collects and reviews data constantly. Technology Business Management (TBM), a best practice discipline for IT business management; and FinOps, the financial operating model for public cloud consumption, share the same goal of defining IT by impact rather than spend. TBM was built to serve the needs of on-prem IT with data-driven decision-making to manage, plan, and optimize spend. TBM has incorporated data-driven decision-making for the cloud but doesn\u2019t manage the complexities of allocating cloud costs and the prescriptive methods of controlling those costs. TBM looks at the \u201cwhat\u201d of all IT spend, including a macro view of cloud spend. By bringing together people (and data) from IT finance, operations, and business, TBM creates a community of stakeholders to manage all IT. FinOps was born for the cloud. Systems, best practices, and cultures increase an organization\u2019s ability to understand cloud costs and make informed and timely balancing decisions. FinOps focuses on optimizing the cost and utilization of the cloud through technical and organizational means. True or False: In regards to cloud forecasting there is no one forecasting method that fits all situations. True Every organization and even cloud provider has different requirements that are to be met or are met. Some organizations my need a granular VM pricing whereas other may not. Some cloud providers support things diffferently than other and therefor require the organization to consider the best model they need. Unfortunately there is no one forecasting method that fits all situations. Cloud spend is variable which is inherently difficult to predict. Specifically engineers can start workloads at any time typically without having to go through a procurement process. Forecasting cloud-provider consumption as product or service consumption requires specific data and tooling to be consistently available. Billing and reporting from cloud providers is difficult to understand and explain to traditional finance teams. Workloads need to be clearly defined whether through tagging or account structures so that cost can be attributed back to them and their owners. Please review this page before the exam. Accurate Cloud Forecasts (finops.org) When proposing the adoption of a FinOps function within an organization, there will be a need to brief a variety of personas among the executive team to gain approval, buy-in, and involvement in conducting FinOps and achieving its goals. Every role has a clearly documented Primary Goal. What is the primary goal for a Chief Technology Officer (CTO)? Leverage technology to give the business a market and competitive advantage Explanation: There are clearly labeled roles for each 'Persona' and we must learn these for the exam. Reference: FinOps Personas True or False: In FinOps decisions are not driven by the business value of the cloud? False In FinOps decisions are driven by the business value of the cloud. With FinOps we look at the cloud as a business value creator. One of the main roles of FinOps is to maximize the value of the cloud spending. Which of the following terms are associated with Agile? Sprint Explicaci\u00f3n : There are several terms affiliated with Agile development such as Sprint, User Story, Epics, Lean, etc. Rightsizing, Zones and Regions are cloud computing terms. Sprint a short interval of work in an Agile project, usually a week or two weeks but sometimes more or less, during which time an agreed-upon amount of work will be delivered. Reference: Please review the Terminology page before the exam. https://www.finops.org/resources/terminology/ In Cloud Computing some costs can be considered fixed and some are variable. Which of the following costs would generally a fixed costs, meaning predictable monthly or annual costs? Support and Maintenance Explanation: Support and Maintenance are almost always a fixed cost meaning that you would pay a certain amount for a specific amount of support/users/response times. Variable costs would be about any resource you would use. Reference: Please review this page before the exam. FinOps Terminology Which of the following roles/personas would be responsible for 'Rate Negations' with a cloud provider? Procurement Explanation: Procurement is handled somewhat different in the world of FinOps. We know that Procurement is moved from a CAPEX to a OPEX manner in the cloud. Procurement should have the following objectives in a FinOps organization. Negotiate the best win-win cloud contract, Exercise enterprise discount / volume commitment programs and Manage relationship with Cloud platform provider. Reference: Please review this page before the exam https://www.finops.org/framework/personas/#product-owner True or False: FinOps is about saving money.
