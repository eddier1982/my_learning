## FinOps Certified Practitioner Introduction

### Cloud Changes IT

 - **DevOps & Cloud**

    **DevOps & Cloud have broken traditional procurement** DevOps allows companies to accelerate technology delivery to meet customer demand using cloud. This shift has put purchasing power in the hands of developers in ways that have broken traditional procurement processes. DevOps and cloud have forced the removal of constraints that has led to the need for a new operating model. This new model allows for collaborative decision making and gives companies the ability to continue to maximize the value of IT investment. This is the premise that led to the development of FinOps. 
    
    **DevOps & Cloud allow for all costs to be attributed to owners** The cost of goods sold for our IT-enabled products and the cost per user of support systems, have always relied upon data centers and infrastructure whose cost is unchangeable. Product owners now have the ability to consume IT services in the exact mix and at the exact times when needed. Product owners can also build in such a way that all of the costs can be examined and taken into account in the pricing, support, and agile development processes. The cloud gives us the ability to develop applications on architectures that scale appropriately to demand, matching IT supply and demand more effectively than ever possible in the data center. All the while, improving our ability to buy incremental small systems and scale to massive heights.
    
    **DevOps & Cloud offer unprecedented opportunities** Procurement and finance now have the ability to see spending in real-time as well as granularity and attribution. Technology leaders who previously needed to face product demand, changes in technology trends, and data center infrastructure challenges, now have the ability to build incrementally. DevOps engineers, once constrained to whatever the infrastructure team had previously purchased within the confines of the data center, are now free to consider using a wide – and ever growing – selection of technologies to solve a range of customer needs. And, more importantly to the organization, DevOps engineers have the right to buy and use only what they need at any given moment.
    
    ***How do we develop the ability to tackle these challenges and take advantage of these new opportunities?***

 - **FinOps**
  
    **The New Operating Model for the Cloud** For many organizations, FinOps is the new operating model for the cloud. FinOps is the practice of bringing technology, business, and finance together to master the unit economics of cloud for competitive advantage. It brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud.

    **Cloud FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice.**

    **Creating a Culture of Accountability** FinOps creates a culture of accountability by supporting product, finance, and business teams to collaborate and make real-time decisions related to tradeoffs between cost, speed, and quality. This drives decisions that increase business value to enhance efficiency and better align costs to business needs as well as improving forecasting of cloud costs.

    ***Before moving on***... 
    
    Think about why your organization is using or moving to the cloud
    
    Consider what you are trying to achieve by using the cloud
